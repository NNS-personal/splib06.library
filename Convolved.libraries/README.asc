This file describes the splib06* convolved spectral libraries.
===============================================================================

Spectral libraries have the 8-character file name:   annccyyd
These files are on specpr binary format.

            a = s for spectral library
            nn= library version number
            cc= output convolved spectrometer model/type
            yy= year or other code
            d = output spectrometer version within year yy


         as = ASTER,
         av = AVIRIS,  e.g. aviris 1995: av95a
         cr = MRO CRISM (orbiting Mars 2007 - date)
         hd = Hydice,
         hy = HyMap
         mi = MIVIS
         mm = Moon Mineralogy Mapper, M3 (2008)
         nm = Galileo NIMS
         pb = probe
         pf = Mars pathfinder
         tm = LandsatTM (followed by 04, 05, 07 for with TM)
         vm = Cassini VIMS (orbiting Saturn 2004 - date)

===============================================================================
Specpr record numbering:
Padding is added to records so that spectra with 1022 channels or
less all have the same record number in the convolved libraries.
===============================================================================

splib06b             specpr binary file

splib06b.list.txt    list of titles and record numbers

splib06b.asc         ASCII conversion of the binary specpr file.

convolution of instrument libraries:

Each specpr file has the entries like this example for Cassini VIMS:

The file is padded to record 29 so that the first convolved spectrum goes into
record 30.  This strategy ensures that spectra with channels 1 to 2171 will
have the same record numbers.  Spectra greater than 2171 channels is not yet
supported.
