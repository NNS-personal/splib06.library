SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:
<p>
This dust sample was collected Sept. 18, 2001 from the sidewalk at the intersection
  of Ann and Nassau Streets about 0.4 km east of the WTC site on Manhattan Island,
  New York. Sample consists of fine-grained grayish white dust believed to be
  from the dust cloud generated when the World Trade Center Towers collapsed on
  Sept. 11, 2001. The sample was probably exposed to rain on the evening of Sept.
  14. A location map and details of the sample collection process are given in
  Roger N. Clark and others, Environmental Studies of the World Trade Center area
  after the September 11, 2001 attack, U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report
  OFR-01-0429. This report is available at http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/

SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:

<p>
There are only weak spectral absorptions, apart from the absorption
edge, in the electronic region of the spectra (0.35 - 1.35 microns)
indicating that the dust contains only low abundances of materials with
Fe absorptions or absorptions from other transition elements.  However,
there are numerous spectral absorptions in the vibrational spectral
region from 1.35 - 2.5 microns principally at 1.45, 1.75, 1.94, 1.97,and
from 2.2 - 2.4 microns.  The strongest spectral feature is at 1.94
microns and is due to structural and adsorbed water, with the next
weaker feature at 1.45 microns (due to water and/or OH).  Spectral
features at 1.75 microns are next weakest with depths of only a few %.
Spectral features in the 2 micron region are weakest.

<p>
Gypsum, probably from crushed wallboard, has the strongest spectral
features accounting for most of the bands observed in the vibrational
portion of the spectra.  This mineral has three diagnostic bands that
form a stair-step like triplet between 1.42 - 1.54 microns recognizable
in nearly all dust samples.  It also has bands at 1.75, 1.95, 1.975,
2.17, 2.217, and 2.268 microns closely matching the positions and
geometry of the bands observed in the dust.  In addition to those
absorptions attributable to gypsum, an absorption at 1.413 microns may
be due to portlandite or muscovite, both mineral components of the WTC
concrete.  Additional absorptions located at 2.307 and 2.343 microns are
due to C-H stretches from organic materials.

<p>
No chrysotile asbestos was detected in this sample above the 1 wt%
lower detection threshold by XRD or spectroscopy.
