SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:
Fireproof coating from steel girder
<p>
Sample WTC01-8 was taken from a coating on a steel girder removed from the
  debris pile west of WTC tower 1. This sample was collected Sept. 18th. The coating
  was very distinct having a different color and texture than the surrounding
  dust. A location map and details of the sample collection process are given
  in Roger N. Clark and others, Environmental Studies of the World Trade Center area
  after the September 11, 2001 attack, U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report
  OFR-01-0429. This report is available at http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/

SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:

<p>
Most notable in its spectrum are absorptions at 1.385 and 2.323
microns which match in position and overall shape those of chrysotile
(RS Figure 3).  Chrysotile is one of three serpentine minerals and the
only one to form with an asbestiform crystal habit.  XRD analysis and
the depth of these spectral absorptions is consistent with chrysotile
forming up to 20 wt% of this coating material.  The position of the
2.323 micron absorption in WTC01-8 is consistent with that of chrysotile
but the band width is somewhat wider possibly indicating the presence of
overlapping 2.307 and 2.343 micron absorptions from dust suppressant
oil.
