SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Sample was prepared from a chemical reagent of Fe2O3. Fine grained powder
  was mixed with water and an eye-dropper was used to deposit a thin coating on
  a microscope glass thin section. The sample was dried over night and them measured
  spectrally. Our goal was to unsaturate the goethite bands and mimic the spectral
  absorptions found in natural goethite coatings.

<p>
For hematite powder: <br>
  average grain size = 200 microns (aggregates) Material opaque, but hematite red in
  powdered form. No impurities observed. Large 50-150 micron grain aggregates are
  composed of 2-3  micron grains. G. Swayze.
<p>
SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:
<p>
Spectrum has Fe-related absorptions characteristic of hematite.  Bands are
located at 0.5427, 0.6615, and 0.8675 microns.  Of note is the narrow width of
the 0.8675 micron band:  it is only 157 nm wide -- much narrower than in
spectra of powdered hematite samples.  Apparently the band narrows most on the
long wavelength side of this band in coatings.

SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1a2_3_4_     # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns
