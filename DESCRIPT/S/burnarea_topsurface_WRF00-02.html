SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:
<p>
This is not a spectrum of a collected sample but it is an average of 16 field
spectra collected of a severely burned area, specifically of
the blackened ash/char coated materials on the soil surface following
a wildfire in a ponderosa pine forest.  The Walker Ranch Fire (also
called the Eldorado Fire at Walker Ranch) occurred on September 15, 2000,
in an area west of Boulder, Colorado. The field spectra were collected on
September 28, 2000.  The fiber optic head of the spectrometer was
held a few inches above the surface of the charred soil.
The field spectra where collected in a 10cm circle (see the area
highlighted in red in the sample photo).
The average of the 16 field spectra was computed then corrected to absolute
reflectance using a National Institute of Standards spectralon correction.
Atmospheric absorptions regions were deleted from the final spectrum
(data points near 1.4, and 1.9 microns and greater than 2.45 microns were modified
in this way to remove all traces of atmospheric residues in the field
spectra).
