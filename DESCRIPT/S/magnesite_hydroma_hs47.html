TITLE: Magnesite+Hydromagnesite HS47 DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: MIXTURE

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: HS47

<p>
MIXTURE_TYPE: Intimate

<p>
MIXTURE: Magnesite + Hydromagnesite (Calcite group)

<p>
FORMULA: MgCO3 + Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2*4H2O

<p>
FORMULA_HTML: MgCO<sub>3</sub> + Mg<sub>5</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>&#8226;4H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Victorville, CA

<p>
ORIGINAL_DONOR: Hunt and Salisbury Collection

<p>
CURRENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION: U.S.G.S. Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

<p>
ULTIMATE_SAMPLE_LOCATION: U.S.G.S. Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

<p>
SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Forms series with Gaspeite and with Siderite.

<p>
Original spectrum published in: <br>
Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, 1971, Visible and near-infrared
spectra of minerals and rocks:  II. Carbonates.  Modern
Geology, v. 2, p. 23-30.

<p>
With the following notes: <br>
"Magnesite, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, is a carbonate mineral commonly found in
veins, and derived from the alteration of serpentine.  Such
magnesites are compact and not recognizably crystalline.
Crystalline magnesite is found in sedimentary rocks, where it has
formed either by primary precipitation or by alteration of dolomite."

<p>
"This sample is of the compact, non-crystalline variety.  It appears
mineralogically pure in hand specimen, but its spectrum displays
bands other than those due to the carbonate ion at the longer
wavelengths.  These bands near 1.4 and 1.9&#181;m are due to water of
hydration and so the sample must be, at least in part, composed of
hydromagnesite, roughly
     Mg<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>&#8226;4H<sub>2</sub>O.
X-ray diffraction indicates only magnesite, but heating to 800&#176;C
shows the presence of 1.78% H<sub>2</sub>O by weight, confirming the
presence of some water of hydration.  The water band near 1.9&#181;m
precludes observation of the three weaker vibrational bands of the
carbonate radical."

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
pure magnesite - Hunt and Salisbury as noted in above sample
description.

<p>
40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
 Reference: JCPDS #8-479 <br>
 Found: Member of the calcite group, probably magnesite, plus at
        least one additional, poorly crystallized phase. <br>
 Sought but not found: brucite <br><br>
 Comment: sharp pattern of crystalline carbonate closely matches
          the JCPDS card for magnesite.  I don't understand why
          the (012) reflection is missing - but it doesn't appear
          on the JCPDS card, either.  There is a moderately weak,
          broad peak (doublet) at 21 degrees 2 theta - thus the comment about
          the additional phase.  Could opaline silica be present??"
