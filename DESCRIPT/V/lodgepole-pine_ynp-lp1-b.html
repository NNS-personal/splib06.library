SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Averaged spectral reflectance for a conifer forest of
lodgepole pine located near the Norris Geyser Basin (north of Gibbon River and
south of Virginia Cascade) of Yellowstone National Park. This forest of
lodgepole pine was classified as growth stage LP1 by Despain (1990).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LP1 forests are 45-150 years old, usually
consist of small diameter lodgepole pine, and have very sparse forest floor
vegetation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This average spectrum
was computed from 135 pixels of radiative-transfer-ground-calibrated AVIRIS
data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>AVIRIS data were collected
on August 6, 1996, at approximately 11:10 am Local Time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>AVIRIS channels 1-4, 32-33, 43, 59-62,
81-84, 95-97, 106-113, 154-167, 173-175, and 222-224 were deleted due to
residual atmospheric effects, poor instrument response, and redundancy where
detectors overlap. Sample referenced in Kokaly and others (2002).
