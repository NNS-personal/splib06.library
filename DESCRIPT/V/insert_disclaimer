Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
