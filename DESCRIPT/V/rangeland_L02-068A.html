<b>Field Observations<br></b>
The plot contains a lot of burned juniper snags and sagebrush stumps.
<P>
<b>Site Orientation<br></b>
The average elevation over the area of the site is 1999 meters (6559 feet).  The average slope of the site is 15 percent, with a Southwest aspect of 212 degrees.
<P>
<b>Site Burn History<br></b>
The area of this plot has recently burned (since 1996).
<P>
<b>Site Location, Dimensions, and Vegetation Sampling<br></b>
The center coordinates of this rangeland plot are 43 deg. 55.051 min. N, 108 deg. 50.165 min. W (datum is NAD83).   The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.

<b>Spectral Measurement Procedures<br></b>
This spectrum is the average of 115 measurements made throughout site L02-068A.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 115 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.  The following channels were deleted (set to a value of -1.23e+34) from the spectrum because of remaining artifacts:  1-6, 410-413, 576-592, 761-801, 1006-1051, 1441-1591, 2111-2151 (corresponding to the wavelength ranges of 0.350-0.355, 0.759-0.762, 0.925-0.941, 1.110-1.150, 1.355-1.400, 1.790-1.940, and 2.460-2.510 microns).

<b>Left Hand Creek General Description<br></b>
The Left Hand Creek Study area is in central Wyoming, located 20 miles northwest of Thermopolis, Wyoming in the "Grass Creek Management Area," managed by the Worland Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management.  The approximate center of the study area is 43.9608 degrees North latitude and 108.8828 degrees West longitude.  The general area consists of lowland creeks (approximate average elevation of 1900 m) covered by mountain big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), grasses and forbs, interspersed with higher ridges (approximate average elevation of 2100 m) covered by mountain big sagebrush, grasses and forbs with some sparsely forested areas containing Limber pine (<i>Pinus flexilis</i>), and Rocky Mountain Juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>) with Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca</i>) on steeper north-facing slopes.
<P>
<b>Project Background<br></b>
This site was measured as part of a cooperative U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Land Management project funded by the Joint Fire Science Program.
