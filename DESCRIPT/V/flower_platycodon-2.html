TITLE: Flower Platycodon-2 White DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: PLANT

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: Platycodon-2

<p>
PLANT_TYPE: Domesticated Plant

<p>
PLANT: Platycodon

<p>
LATIN_NAME: <i>Platycodon</i> sp.

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Lakewood, Colorado

<p>
ORIGINAL_DONOR:

<p>
SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Average reflectance for a white flower of the
platycodon plant (<i>Platycodon</i> sp.). The small flowers of
the plant were 3-6 cm in diameter.
The platycodon plant was growing in a domestic garden.
<p>
The spectra were collected with the head of the spectrometer pointed
approximately 45 degrees off-nadir, approximately 2-3 centimeters from the
surface of the flower.  The spectrometer head (bare fiber optic) was
moved over different parts of the flower petals in order
to compute the average reflectance for the flower from any variations
in the individual petals.
This average spectrum was computed from 14 individual recorded spectra
(each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 measurements).
<p>
Sky conditions during the measurement were cloud-free.
