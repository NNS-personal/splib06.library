The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements. Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C03-004.html:This spectrum is the average of 36 measurements made throughout site C03-004.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 36 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.  The following channels were deleted (set to a value of -1.23e+34) from the spectrum because of remaining artifacts:  1-6, 410-413, 576-592, 761-801, 1006-1051, 1441-1591, 2111-2151 (corresponding to the wavelength ranges of 0.350-0.355, 0.759-0.762, 0.925-0.941, 1.110-1.150, 1.355-1.400, 1.790-1.940, and 2.460-2.510 microns).

rangeland_C03-019.html:The center coordinates of this rangeland plot are 41 deg. 49.262 min. N, 119 deg. 18.708 min. W (datum is NAD83).   The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C03-019.html:This spectrum is the average of 57 measurements made throughout site C03-019.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 57 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.  The following channels were deleted (set to a value of -1.23e+34) from the spectrum because of remaining artifacts:  1-6, 410-413, 576-592, 761-801, 1006-1051, 1441-1591, 2111-2151 (corresponding to the wavelength ranges of 0.350-0.355, 0.759-0.762, 0.925-0.941, 1.110-1.150, 1.355-1.400, 1.790-1.940, and 2.460-2.510 microns).

rangeland_C03-041.html:The center coordinates of this rangeland plot are 41 deg. 48.668 min. N, 119 deg. 19.160 min. W (datum is NAD83).   The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C03-041.html:This spectrum is the average of 47 measurements made throughout site C03-041.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 47 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C03-073.html:This spectrum is the average of 46 measurements made throughout site C03-073.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C03-086.html:This spectrum is the average of 67 measurements made throughout site C03-086.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 67 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C04-153.html:This spectrum is the average of 65 measurements made throughout site C04-153.

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C04-200.html:This spectrum is the average of 39 measurements made throughout site C04-200.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 39 spectra was computed.

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_C04-226.html:This spectrum is the average of 52 measurements made throughout site C04-226.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).

The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_L02-005.html:This spectrum is the average of 116 measurements made throughout site L02-005.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 116 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.

rangeland_L02-042.html:The average elevation over the area of the site is 1977 meters (6486 feet).  The average slope of the site is 9 percent, with a Southeast aspect of 129 degrees.
rangeland_L02-042.html:The center coordinates of this rangeland plot are 43 deg. 56.741 min. N, 108 deg. 50.420 min. W (datum is NAD83).   The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.
rangeland_L02-042.html:This spectrum is the average of 100 measurements made throughout site L02-042.  These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 100 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.  The following channels were deleted (set to a value of -1.23e+34) from the spectrum because of remaining artifacts:  1-6, 410-413, 576-592, 761-801, 1006-1051, 1441-1591, 2111-2151 (corresponding to the wavelength ranges of 0.350-0.355, 0.759-0.762, 0.925-0.941, 1.110-1.150, 1.355-1.400, 1.790-1.940, and 2.460-2.510 microns).

rangeland_L02-058.html:The Left Hand Creek Study area is in central Wyoming, located 20 miles northwest of Thermopolis, Wyoming in the "Grass Creek Management Area," managed by the Worland Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management.  The approximate center of the study area is 43.9608 degrees North latitude and 108.8828 degrees West longitude.  The general area consists of lowland creeks (approximate average elevation of 1900 m) covered by mountain big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), grasses and forbs, interspersed with higher ridges (approximate average elevation of 2100 m) covered by mountain big sagebrush, grasses and forbs with some sparsely forested areas containing Limber pine (<i>Pinus flexilis</i>), and Rocky Mountain Juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>) with Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca</i>) on steeper north-facing slopes.

rangeland_L02-060.html:The center coordinates of this rangeland plot are 43 deg. 56.807 min. N, 108 deg. 51.683 min. W (datum is NAD83).   The diameter of this circular vegetation plot was 15.2 meters.  Within this plot, four subplots of 0.5 meter diameter were established 5 meters from the center at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south and west).  Within these subplots, grass and forb species were identified and associated percent cover of each were visually estimated.  Litter cover and the percent area of bare ground were also visually estimated.  For each shrub in the larger plot, the species was identified, the lateral dimensions were measured, and the height was measured.  The cover of trees, shrubs, grasses, forbs, litter and bare ground were calculated from the full plot and subplot measurements.  Field identifications of <i>Tetradymia canescens</i> (winterfat) were inconsistent between the 2003 and 2004 field seasons.  In 2003, some shrubs were identified as <i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> (gray rabbitbrush) and <i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i> (winterfat).  Later, it was determined that some of these shrubs were incorrectly identified and it was decided to label them all as <i>Tetradymia canescens</i>.

These spectra were collected using an ASD Full Range Field Pro spectrometer in reflectance mode, relative to a Spectralon reference panel.  While walking through the site, the fiber optic cable was pointed at nadir (straight down) at approximately shoulder height.  The instrument was programmed to record 6 second averages of reflectance while moving through the site (thus, each recorded spectrum was an average of 60 individual measurements).  These recorded spectra were examined for artifacts due to low signal:noise, detector offsets and atmospheric contamination.  Those spectra with large artifacts were not included in further processing.  An average of the remaining 68 spectra was computed.  This average spectrum was converted to absolute reflectance by multiplying by the reflectance spectrum of the Spectralon reference panel.  The following channels were deleted (set to a value of -1.23e+34) from the spectrum because of remaining artifacts:  1-6, 410-413, 576-592, 761-801, 1006-1051, 1441-1591, 2111-2151 (corresponding to the wavelength ranges of 0.350-0.355, 0.759-0.762, 0.925-0.941, 1.110-1.150, 1.355-1.400, 1.790-1.940, and 2.460-2.510 microns).
rangeland_L04-047.html:The Left Hand Creek Study area is in central Wyoming, located 20 miles northwest of Thermopolis, Wyoming in the "Grass Creek Management Area," managed by the Worland Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management.
