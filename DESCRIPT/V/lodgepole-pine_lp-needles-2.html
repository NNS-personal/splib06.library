TITLE: Lodgepole-Pine LP-Needles-2 DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: PLANT

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: LP-Needles-2

<p>
PLANT_TYPE: Coniferous Tree

<p>
PLANT: Lodgepole Pine

<p>
LATIN_NAME: <i>Pinus contorta</i>

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming

<p>
ORIGINAL_DONOR: Raymond Kokaly

<p>
SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Reflectance of oven-dried needles of lodgepole
pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) measured in the laboratory.
The dried, green needles were stacked in a sample cup and
the head of the spectrometer fiber optic cable was passed
over the needles.
<p>
The needles were dried in an oven for 72 hours at 36&#176
Celsius.  The vegetation was sampled in Yellowstone National
Park and kept in a plastic bag, on ice, for four days until
measured.  As a result, some of the plant moisture
was lost during the storage time.  Also, some of the
chlorophyll was likely degraded.
<p>
A related spectrum (sample ID = LP-Needles-1) of this
collection of lodgepole needles was measured before oven
drying the needles for 72 hours at 30&#176 Celsius.
Fresh weight of the needles was 6.38 g and dry weight
was 3.15 grams.
