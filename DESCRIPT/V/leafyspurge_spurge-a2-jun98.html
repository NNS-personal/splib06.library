TITLE: LeafySpurge Spurge-A2-Jun98 DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: PLANT

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: Spurge-A2-Jun98

<p>
PLANT_TYPE: Invasive herbaceous perennial weed

<p>
PLANT: Leafy spurge

<p>
LATIN_NAME: <i>Euphorbia esula</i> L.

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Golden, Colorado

<p>

<p>
SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Average reflectance for the yellow-green, flowering tops of the invasive plant
  species leafy spurge (<i>Euphorbia esula</i> L.). Leafy spurge plants were harvested
  and combined into a densely packed bouquet. The spectrometer head was passed
  over the top of the bouquet in order to measure the reflectance from primarily
  the yellow-green flower bracts of the leafy spurge plant.
<p>
The spurge plants that were harvested were 0.3 to 0.6 m in height.
Leaves of the spurge plants were green in color. Nearly all plants
had developed yellow-green flower bracts, which dominated the tops
of the plants.
<p>
The spectra were collected with the head of the spectrometer pointed approximately
  at nadir, approximately 10 centimeters above the surface of the bouquet, while
  the operator walked through the area recording spectra. This average spectrum
  was computed from 34 individual recorded spectra (each recorded spectrum was
  an average of 30 measurements).
<p>
The spectra were measured on June 8, 1998.
<p>
This area of leafy spurge from which the leafy spurge plants were collected
is situated on a southwest facing slope in an area that had been grazed by
cattle.  The general location is a rural area
on the northern edge of the city of Golden, Colorado (GPS coordinates are
39 degrees 47.062 minutes N latitude, 105 degrees 14.425 minutes W longitude;
Datum = WGS84).
<p>
The specific location (Site A) of the area from which this average spectrum
was computed is 25 meter NW of the given GPS coordinates.
<p>
Sky conditions during the measurement were partly-cloudy.
<p>
A related sample, Spurge-A1-Jun98, was measured of the area from which
these leafy spurge plants were collected.
