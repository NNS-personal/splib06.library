TITLE: LeafySpurge Spurge-B3-Jul98 DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: PLANT

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: Spurge-B3-Jul98

<p>
PLANT_TYPE: Invasive herbaceous perennial weed

<p>
PLANT: Leafy spurge

<p>
LATIN_NAME: <i>Euphorbia esula</i> L.

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Golden, Colorado

SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Average reflectance for the green leaves
the invasive plant species leafy spurge (<i>Euphorbia esula</i> L.).
The leafy spurge plants in the general area had green leaves. Only a
few plants had retained their yellow-green flower bracts.  The
surrounding grass cover was dry, brown, and sensescent.
<p>
The spectra were collected with the head of the spectrometer pointed
slightly off-nadir, approximately 3 centimeters from the leaf surface.
This average spectrum was computed from 10 individual recorded spectra
(each recorded spectrum was an average of 30 measurements).
<p>
The spectra were measured on July 10, 1998.
<p>
This area of leafy spurge is situated on a southwest facing slope in an
area that had been grazed by cattle.  The general location is a rural area
on the northern edge of the city of Golden, Colorado (GPS coordinates are
39 degrees 47.062 minutes N latitude, 105 degrees 14.425 minutes W longitude;
Datum = WGS84).
<p>
The specific location (Site B) of the area from which the leaves of the
leafy spurge plant was measured is 60 meters SE of the given GPS coordinates.
<p>
Sky conditions during the measurement were mostly clear with a few small,
patchy clouds.
<p>
Related spectra were taken in this same area (Spurge-B1-Jul98 and
Spurge-B2-Jul98).
