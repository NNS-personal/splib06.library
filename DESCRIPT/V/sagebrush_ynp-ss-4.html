DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: PLANT

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: YNP-SS-4

<p>

<p>
PLANT: Big Sagebrush

<p>
LATIN_NAME: <i>Artemisia tridentata</i>

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Lamar Valley area of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Averaged spectral reflectance for an area dominated by
big sagebrush located in the Lamar Valley area of Yellowstone National Park.
This area was described by Despain (1990) as big sagebrush/Idaho fescue
habitat. The grasses in this area were greener than in the areas of samples
YNP-SS1 and YNP-SS2 because of the relatively higher elevation of this site.
This average spectrum was computed from 51 pixels of
radiative-transfer-ground-calibrated AVIRIS data.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>AVIRIS data were collected on August 6, 1996, at
approximately 11:10 am Local Time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>AVIRIS channels 1-4, 32-33, 43, 59-62, 81-84, 95-97, 106-113, 154-167,
173-175, and 222-224 were deleted due to residual atmospheric effects, poor
instrument response, and redundancy where detectors overlap.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Channel 7 was also deleted because of
spurious detector response in some of the pixels. Sample referenced in Kokaly
and others (2002).
