SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"0-15A.  Rutile.  Oaxaca, Mexico.  (126B).  Rutile, TiO<sub>2</sub>, is not a major
rock-forming mineral, but is the commonest form of TiO<sub>2</sub> in nature,
and is very widely distributed as minute grains in many igneous and
metamorphic rocks.  Because of its resistance to weathering, it is also
common in beach and river sands.  TiO<sub>2</sub> has a 3d&#176; configuration,
so that if a 3d band exists, it will normally be empty.  It is possible
to supply electrons to the 3d band by excitation from impurities,
imperfections, or from the filled 2p band.  The intense absorption in
the blue is ascribed by Bevan and others  (1958) as an exciton band arising
from the transfer of an electron from an oxygen to a titanium.  This
sample contains 0.3% Fe, which does not appear to be located in a
crystal field capable of producing the typical ferrous or ferric iron
features near 1.0&#181; or 0.8&#181;.  The steep fall-off in reflectivity
toward the blue, which results in the reddish brown color common to
rutile, is thus probably caused both by extrinsic absorption in the
ferric ion and a sloping of the normal absorption edge in TiO<sub>2</sub>
because of defects and edge effects.  Increasing amounts of ferric iron,
niobium, and tantalum, which also enter the TiO<sub>2</sub> lattice, result in
deeper and deeper color, some varieties being almost opaque.  The weak
but sharp feature near 2.3&#181; must be due to some hydroxyl combination
tone in this sample of rutile.  It is an unusual band because no
corresponding band near 1.4&#181; is apparent, and because chemical
analysis of this sample yielded no measurable water.  We conclude that a
hydroxylated impurity is present in very small amount, and perhaps not
at all in the portion of the sample analyzed."
