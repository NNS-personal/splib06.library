SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"H-4. Halite. Kansas (433B). Halite, NaCl, occurs primarily as extensive beds
  formed by evaporation of trapped bodies of salt water. It may also form as an
  efflorescence on the surface in arid areas, or as a sublimation product in volcanic
  regions. It is colorless when pure, but more typically orange or red, and may
  be gray, yellow or blue. The common orange or red color is due to inclusions
  of ferric oxide material, while the gray is due to inclusions of clay. Like
  many of the halides, halite is subject to color center formation, which is responsible
  for the blue and purple tints. This sample is colorless and appears to be quite
  pure. It displays some very weak water bands from water in fluid inclusions
  near 1.95 and 2.25 &#181;, but is otherwise spectrally featureless, except for
  the 0-5 &#181; particle size range. The distinct brownish tone of this size
  range is caused by polyurethane contamination from the fluid energy mill."

Sieve interval 74 - 250&#181;m.

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File: halt433.mdi, *.out (smear mount on quartz plate) <br>
References: JCPDS #5-628; Huebner's internal standard listings <br>
Found: Halite <br><br>
  Comment: Reflections symmetrical but not sharp and the alpha1-alpha2 splitting
  is not distinct; the degree of crystallization is only moderate. Lattice spacing's
  are consistent with NaCl composition (and inconsistent with (Na,K)Cl solid solution.

MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:

<p>
average grain size= 230 &#181;m
<p>
Grains isotropic with cubic cleavage. Grains also have abundant (8 vol%) fluid
  or gas inclusions, and the grains are soluble in water. All this is consistent
  with this sample being pure salt.
