TITLE: Magnetite HS78 DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: MINERAL

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: HS78

<p>
MINERAL_TYPE: Oxide

<p>
MINERAL: Magnetite (Spinel group)

<p>
FORMULA: Fe+2(Fe+3)2O4

<p>
FORMULA_HTML: Fe<sup>+2</sup>Fe<sup>+3</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Farmington County, Colorado

<p>
ORIGINAL_DONOR: Hunt and Salisbury Collection

<p>
CURRENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION: USGS Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Forms series with Gaspeite and with Siderite.

<p>
The spectrum of this sample was originally published in:

<p>
Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1971, Visible
and near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  III.
Oxides  and hydroxides.  Modern Geology, v. 2, p. 195-205.

<p>
With the note: "Magnetite, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes found in
veins of large masses as a product of magmatic segregation, and as
beds or lenses in metamorphic rocks.  Most commonly, it is an
accessory mineral in igneous rocks, and it is frequently associated
with the heavy fraction of beach and river sands because of its
resistance to weathering.  As in the case of this sample, magnetite
is typically an opaque spectrally featureless mineral in the visible
and near-infrared.  It contains both ferrous and ferric ion, and Al,
V, and Cr may substitute for the Fe<sup>+3</sup>, while Ca, Mn, and Mg, Ni,
Ca, and Zr may replace some Fe<sup>+2</sup>.  A considerable amount of Ti
can also enter the magnetite structure.  Except in rare cases of
substantial substitution, however, all magnetites display opaque
behavior.  This particular sample is titaniferous, and the
explanation for its opacity must be similar to that given for
ilmenite [HS231], with additional contributions being made to the
general absorption property by all the substituents present."

<p>
The sample measured for the library was HS78.3 which was dry sieved
to the grain size interval 74-250&#181;m.

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
40 kV - 30 mA, 7.3-9.5 keV <br>
File:  magnt78.mdi (bulk sample); magnt78b.mdi; magnt78c.mdi (non-magnetic fraction)
(All smears on quartz plate) <br>
References:  Huebner's reference patterns; PDF2 #10-0393, 16-0344, 17-0464, 18-1202,
19-0629, 19-1184, 29-0733, 33-1161, 34-0192; Deer, Howie, and Zussman (1962) <br>
Found:  Fe-rich spinel, plagioclase; traces of ilmenite, Al-rich spinel, mica, and
quartz <br><br>
Comments:  Pattern of bulk material consists of a set of broad, moderate to strong
peaks with no resolution of alpha1-alpha2 and a second set of sharp, weak to
moderate peaks, some with good resolution of alpha1-alpha2.  The major phase is
face-centered cubic with 8.40 Angstrom cell edge, consistent with magnetite (or
magnesioferrite or a spinel-group solid solution).  The non-magnetic fraction was
deciphered using pattern magnt78c.mdi.  The ilmenite has lattice spacings close
to those of endmember FeTiO3 and the second FCC phase has an 8.13 Angstrom cell
edge, consistent with hercynite or spinel (the species, MgAl2O4).  Reflections at
2.79 and 2.27 Angstroms were not identified.  The ragged peak between 8.5 and 7.9
Angstroms is assumed to be instrumental because it appears in other patterns.
