SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"S-18C. Aventurine Quartz. India (117B). Aventurine quartz is a rare variety
  that has brilliant scales of mica or hematite distributed within it. This particular
  sample has mica inclusions, as can be seen by comparing the hydroxyl bands near
  1.4&#181; and between 2.2 and 2.6&#181; with those of muscovite. The very strong
  band near 0.6&#181;m is not due to the muscovite. We do not know the origin
  of this band. Some blue quartz which has been analyzed yields Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  (0.5%) and small amounts of TiO<sub>2</sub> as impurities. A band has been observed
  in some blue Beryl's at 0.62&#181;, but its origin has been attributed to Fe<sup>+2</sup>
  in axial channels, and definitely not to Fe<sup>+2</sup> or Fe<sup>+3</sup>
  in the Si tetrahedral site."

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
40 kV- 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File:  qtz117.mdi (70 degrees to 16 degrees), qtz117-2.mdi (16 degrees to 5
degrees) <br>
References:  Huebner's reference patterns; Borg and Smith (1969); PDF2 #06-0263,
19-0814, 26-0911, 33-1161 <br>
Found:  Quartz, minor 2M1 dioctahedral mica <br><br>
Comments:  Peaks are sharp; quartz shows excellent resolution of the
alpha1-alpha2 components.  Profile-based search-match returns quartz and the 2M1
illite as the most likely phases.  Of all phlogopite and muscovite patterns in
the PDF2 database, only 2M1 muscovites (06-0263, 19-0814) give satisfactory fits.
Weak reflections at 5.9 and 5.1 Angstroms were not identified.  A very weak peak
appears at 7.1 Angstroms in the strip chart but was not resolved in the smoothed
digital data.
