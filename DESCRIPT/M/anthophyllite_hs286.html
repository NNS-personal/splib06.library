TITLE: Anthophyllite HS286 DESCRIPT

<p>

DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: MINERAL

<p>

SAMPLE_ID: HS286

<p>

MINERAL_TYPE: Inosilicate

<p>

MINERAL: Anthophyllite (Amphibole group)

<p>

FORMULA: (Mg,Fe+2)7Si8O22(OH)2

<p>

FORMULA_HTML: (Mg,Fe<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>

<p>

COLLECTION_LOCALITY: North Carolina

<p>

ORIGINAL_DONOR: Hunt and Salisbury Collection

<p>

CURRENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION: USGS Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

<p>

ULTIMATE_SAMPLE_LOCATION: USGS Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

<p>

SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>

Forms series with Magnesio-anthophyllite and Ferro-anthophyllite.

<p>

Spectra for this sample were originally published in:
Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1973, Visible
and near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  VI. Additional
silicates.  Modern Geology, v. 4, p. 85-106.

<p>

With the note: "The dominant feature in its spectrum is the very
well defined band at 0.95&#181;m due to Fe<sup>+2</sup> in the octahedral site,
and this is accompanied by bands at 0.375, 0.475 and 0.65&#181;m.  The
very weak 0.65&#181;m band indicates the presence of a very little
ferric iron which enters the mineral when aluminum substitutes for
silicon.  Bands at 1.4, 2.32, and 2.4&#181;m are all due to the OH
vibrations, and there is a complete absence of evidence for
molecular H<sub>2</sub>O."

<p>

Sample measured for the library was the 74-250&#181;m sieve interval, 3B.

<p>

Hunt and others also noted some magnetite contamination, but with the
high reflectance level at 1.6 &#181;m it must be very low.  Roger N.

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>

40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File: anth286_mdi, *.out (smear mount on quartz plate) <br>
References: Huebner's reference patterns; PDF2 #12-0242 21-1227;
HS-286.3B (anth286b_MDI and anthp286_MDI) <br>
Found: Talc, anthophyllite, minor 14 Angstroms-chlorite, possible trace
of mica <br><br>
  Comment: Talc peaks are strong and the basal reflections are very sharp; resolution
  of the alpha1-alpha2 reflections is good. Amphibole peaks are much less intense
  but sharp. Theses phases appear homogeneous in composition and well crystallized.
  The amphibole is orthorhombic and its pattern is consistent with that of anthophyllite.
  (Comparison and random and smear mounts proves that talc is the dominant phase.)
  A minor chlorite phase displayed basal spacing's consistent with chamosite 1M
  or clinochlore 1M. A trace of mica (reflection at 10.4 Angstroms) could not be
  further characterized. Very weak un indexed reflections at 8.6 and 7.4 Angstroms.
  Very fine-grained sample.

40 kV -30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File: anthp286_mdi, *.out (smear mount of 3B on quartz plate) <br>
anth286b_mdi, *.out (edge/random mount of 3B) <br>
anth286_mdi, *.out (smear mount of ground 4B) <br>
References: JCPDS #13-558; Borg and Smith (1969); Huebner's reference patterns <br>
  Found: Talc, subordinate orthoamphibole, minor chlorite, trace mica (?), un
  indexed reflections of a minor phase(s) at 7.4 Angstroms (weak intensity), 4.55
  (strong, broad) 3.56 (medium), 2.63 (medium, broad), 2.49 (strong, broad), 2.45
  (medium, broad), 2.23 (medium weak, broad), 1.42 (weak, broad) <br>
  <br>
Comment: Orthoamphibole pattern is consistent with anthophyllite or gedrite, but
not with holmquistite.  Chlorite identification based on three basal reflections;
mica based on one basal reflection in a smear mount (this reflection is absent in a
random mount).  HS-286.3B extremely fine grained, like talcum powder; HS-286.4B is
coarse but the grains are soft.  Talc and chlorite reflections are sharp,
suggesting good crystallinity.  The orthoamphibole and the unidentified reflections
are of variable sharpness.

None.

END_COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION.

MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:

<p>

Asbestiform crystal habit, pale color due to Fe-staining?  Length
slow, straight extinction.  No twinning.  These characteristics are
consistent with anthophyllite.  Grain size is that of clumps of
fibres.  G. Swayze
