SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Original Spectrum published in:
Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1973, Visible
and near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  VI. Additional
silicates.  Modern Geology, v. 4, p. 85-106.

<p>
With the note:"In addition to the substitutions given in the
general formula for lepidolite, considerable amounts of sodium,
rubidium and cesium may substitute for potassium; and iron,
manganese and magnesium may substitute for aluminum.  It is the
substituted ferric iron and manganese that give rise to the bands at
0.8&#181;, 0.55 &#181;, and 0.45&#181;, together with the drop off to the
extreme blue.  The band near 1.4&#181; is due to the overtone of the
OH stretching fundamental, and the very weak band at 1.9&#181;
indicates that a small amount of included water is present.  The
bands near 2.2&#181;, 2.35&#181;, and 2.45&#181; are also due to
combination bands involving the OH stretch and possibly the Al-O-H
bending mode (at 2.2&#181;) as discussed above, and the very weak
bands at 1.28&#181;, 1.33&#181;, 2.03&#181; and 2.14&#181; are OH combined
with lattice modes."

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File:  lpd1673B.mdi (thick smear on quartz plate) <br>
References:  Huebner's reference patterns; JCPDS patterns for micas; Deer, Howie,
and Zussman (1962); Bailey (1984a,b); PDF2 #33-1161, 42-1399, 41-1480,
15-0062, 09-0466 <br>
Found:  Quartz, a lepidolite-group mica, minor albite <br><br>
Comment:  The pattern is dominated by strong, sharp quartz reflections.  Mica
reflections are sharp but not sufficiently intense to show clear separation of
alpha1-alpha2 components, even at high 2 theta.  The mica phase was compared to
Huebner's reference patterns and the JCPDS mica indexes.  Both 2M1 and 2M2
lepidolites and muscovites yield good matches.  Search-match based on eight strong
lines returns quartz, zinnwaldite, and calcian albite; little of the intensity of a
reflection at 4.96 Angstroms was explained by zinnwaldite (002).  Profile based
search-match returned quartz, ordered albite, zinnwaldite, lepidolite-12O as
likely hits.  The reflection at 4.96 Angstroms is explained by lepidolite
superlattice reflection (00.12); zinnwaldite contributes little to the
interpretation of the pattern.  Examination of the original sample shows a
distinctive lavender-violet color implying that a member of the lepidolite mica
group is present.
