SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Spex standard 81.6% Pr Lot No. 05791

<p>
Reflectance spectra for reagent-grade Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
  Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> show the intense,
  narrow absorption bands caused by electronic transitions in trivalent rare earth
  elements (White, 1967; Dieke and Crosswhite, 1963). The absorption patterns
  produced by each of these oxides is distinctive for the particular rare earth
  element involved. The positions of the major bands for Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  and Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are indicated in Table 2. Absorption features
  that occur near 1.4 and 1.9 &#181; cannot be unambiguously assigned to water
  or hydroxyl since some rare earth element oxides, notably Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  and Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, have electronic bands in these wavelength regions.
  The cause of the 2.35&#181; bands in two of the rare earth element oxide samples
  also has not been determined. Although White (1967) tentatively attributed similar
  features to water, the bands could be produced by minor amounts of CO<sub>3</sub>
  or possibly by an undocumented REE-OH vibrational overtone. No carbonate or
  hydroxyl-bearing phases were detected by X-ray diffraction analysis of the rare
  earth element oxide samples.

XRD_ANALYSIS:

40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File:  prox35,mdi (smear mount on quartz plate) <br>
References:  JCPDS #24-1006, 22-0848, 40-08240, 45-11740 <br>
  Found: PrO2 Cubic; Eight unindexed reflections at 3.23, 2.80. 2.24, 2.11, 1.87,
  1.84, 1.83 and 1.44 Angstroms.<br>
  <br>
  Comment: The dominant phase has strong narrow peaks but poor resolution of alpha1-alpha2.
  The cell face-centered cubic with a=5.39 Angstroms; peak positions and intensities
  match those in JCPDS #24-1006. The unindexed reflections are moderately weak
  to weak, broad, poorly formed, and do not resolve alpha1-alpha2. Simple boolean
  search of the PDF database using Pr composition and the two strongest unindexed
  reflections (at 3.23 and 2.24 Angstroms) suggests that K3PrF6 and K2PrF5 (which
  have peaks that overlap those of cubic PrO2) may be contaminants.

SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:
<p>
We have no reference spectra to evaluate the potential spectral
interference from K3PrF6 or K2PrF5.  We are tentatively assigning a
spectral purity of "b" based on the assumed spectral purity of this
reagent grade chemical sample.  G. Swayze
