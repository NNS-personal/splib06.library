TITLE: Cassiterite HS279 DESCRIPT

<p>
DOCUMENTATION_FORMAT: MINERAL

<p>
SAMPLE_ID: HS279

<p>
MINERAL_TYPE: Oxide

<p>
MINERAL: Cassiterite (Rutile group)

<p>
FORMULA: SnO2

<p>
FORMULA_HTML: SnO<sub>2</sub>

<p>
COLLECTION_LOCALITY: Nigeria

<p>
ORIGINAL_DONOR: Hunt and Salisbury Collection

<p>
CURRENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION: USGS Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

<p>
ULTIMATE_SAMPLE_LOCATION: USGS Denver Spectroscopy Laboratory

<p>
SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Close to SnO<sub>2</sub> with Sn 78.6%, O 21.4%.  Small amounts of Fe<sup>+3</sup> may
be present and lesser amounts of Nb and Ta substitute for Sn.  The
structure is that of rutile.

<p>
"O-2.  Cassiterite.  Nigeria (279B).  Cassiterite, SnO<sub>2</sub>, is the most
important ore of tin.  It is often found in hydrothermal veins or
pegmatites, but also forms as a result of secondary processes in the
oxidation zone of weathered tin deposits.  Ferric iron is usually
present as well as small amounts of tantalum and niobium (columbium).  Because
features due to the Sn<sup>2+</sup> ion occur only in the ultraviolet, it is
the presence of impurities which color the cassiterite so that it is
commonly reddish brown to almost black.  This particular sample is a
dark reddish brown massive variety, with inclusions of limonite and
quartz.  The fall-off in reflectivity of this sample toward the blue we
attribute to the presence of iron (0.2% by weight), which produces a
tailing off of the absorption edge of the conduction band due to
extrinsic absorption.  Near-infrared iron bands, which are seen in other
minerals in this series, are not displayed by cassiterite, because the
iron is not in an octahedral site.  In addition, the low reflectivity in
the 1&#181; region would tend to quench any bands, such as should be
displayed by a limonitic contaminant.  The principal effect of this
contaminant is seen in the largest particle size range, which has a
slightly higher reflectivity than the 74- 250&#181; size range.
Inspection of the 250-1200&#181; sample reveals that light colored
limonite and quartz inclusions are present as individual grains in this
size range, which probably explains its higher reflectivity.  The
reflectivity of all size ranges is reduced substantially in the infrared
after acid leaching has removed most of the ferric oxide."

The spectrum here goes to 0.2 &#181;m, considerably shorter than the Hunt
and others  spectrum in the above paper.  From the new spectrum, we can see
that the features are not those of limonite.  However, the limonite
impurity may brighten the spectrum slightly.  Roger N.  Clark

XRD_ANALYSIS:

40 kV - 30 mA, 7.0-9.5 keV <br>
  File: cstrt279.out, -.mdi<br>
Reference: JCPDS 41-1445 <br>
Found: cassiterite <br>
Quartz sought but not found <br><br>
Comment: Exceptionally sharp peaks indicate high degree of
crystallinity and compositional homogeneity.  Found all reflections
with intensity > 1%. No other reflections present.

    8 vol% magnetite (may be intergrown with cassiterite) <br>

<p>
Translucent red, high birefringence, weak pleochroism, all
consistent with cassiterite.  Acid wash and Franz-separator
treatment may be able to remove impurities.  G. Swayze.
