SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Spex Standard 84.3% Nd Lot No. 02831R

<p>
Reflectance spectra for reagent-grade Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
  Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Fig. 2) show the
  intense, narrow absorption bands caused by electronic transitions in trivalent
  rare earth elements (White, 1967; Dieke and Crosswhite, 1963). The absorption
  patterns produced by each of these oxides is distinctive for the particular
  rare earth element involved. The positions of the major bands for Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  and Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are indicated in Table 2. Absorption features
  that occur near 1.4 and 1.9 &#181; cannot be unambiguously assigned to water
  or hydroxyl since some rare earth element oxides, notably Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  and Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, have electronic bands in these wavelength regions
  (Fig. 2). The cause of the 2.35&#181; bands in two of the rare earth element
  oxide samples (Fig. 2) also has not been determined. Although White (1967) tentatively
  attributed similar features to water, the bands could be produced by minor amounts
  of CO<sub>3</sub> or possibly by an undocumented REE-OH vibrational overtone.
  No carbonate or hydroxyl-bearing phases were detected by X-ray diffraction analysis
  of the rare earth element oxide samples."

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File: ndoxid34.mdi, *.out (smear mount on quartz plate) <br>
References: JCPDS #21-579, 43-1023, 6-601, 13-85; Huebner's reference
patterns. <br>
Found: Neodymium Hydroxide, Nd(OH)3 <br><br>
Comment: The hydroxide reflections are sharp at 2 theta < 35 degrees,
broad at 2 theta = 35-70 degrees.  The alpha1-alpha2 reflections are not
resolved.  A weak, broad, unindexed reflection at 1.77 Angstroms
corresponds to a weak reflection of high-pressure Nd2O3, but since this
reflection is also present in Huebner's reference pattern of
reagent-grade Nd2O3, it may be a Nd-hydroxide peak that was omitted by
JCPDS.
