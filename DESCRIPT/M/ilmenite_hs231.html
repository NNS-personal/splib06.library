Forms series with Geikielite.

<p>
"O-10.  Ilmenite.  Norway (231B).  Ilmenite, FeTiO<sub>3</sub>, is sometimes
found in veins or large masses as a product of magmatic segregation, and
as beds or lenses in metamorphic rocks.  Most commonly, it is an
accessory mineral in igneous rocks, and it is frequently associated with
the heavy fraction of beach and river sands.  As in the case of this <br>
sample, ilmenite is typically an opaque, almost spectrally featureless
mineral in the visible and near-infrared.  The relative reflectivity of
the various particle sizes is typical of an opaque mineral--i.e., the
smaller the particle size, the lower the reflectivity.  Pure ilmenite is
considered to be a titanate of ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup> Ti<sup>4+</sup>O<sub>3</sub>)
rather than a double sesquioxide of ferric iron and titanium (Fe<sup>3+</sup>
Ti<sup>3+</sup> O<sub>3</sub>).  In ilmenite ferric oxide is often present and can
introduce features typical of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion.  When as little as 1% Ti
is substituted in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the titanium acts as a donor and is all
ionized to Ti<sup>4+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and the Fe<sup>2+</sup> produces a broad
feature centered near 1.5&#181;.  We have already observed a broad feature
centered near 1.8&#181; in the pyroxenes (see Part I) which was attributed
to the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion in a disordered octahedral site.  The hydrated
titanium ion (Ti<sup>3+</sup> 6H<sub>2</sub>O) produces a very broad spectral feature
extending from 0.5&#181; into the infrared with a maximum at 2.0&#181;.  The
overall opacity of ilmenite is probably caused by a combination of all
these features, broadened by defects, edge effects and the presence of
impurities, as well as conduction bands due to both the iron and
titanium extending out from the ultraviolet into the visible."

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
40 kV - 30 mA, 7.3-9.5 keV <br>
Files: ilmnt231.out, -.mdi, ground once; ilm231-2_*, ground twice;
ilm231-3.*, same material as ilmnt231 <br>
References: JCDPS 29-733 (ilmenite) and 24-0074 (hematite);
Huebner's reference patterns; SEM X-ray spectroscopy; light optical
microscopy <br>
Found: ilmenite, minor hematite and orthopyroxene, trace muscovite.
Also weak unidentified reflections at 4.06, 2.94, 2.101, 2.028,
1.70, 1.44, and 1.395 Angstroms <br>
Sought but not found: Quartz <br><br>
Comment: Very well crystallized ilmenite and hematite.  Observed
hematite as exsolution lamellae in ilmenite using BSE imaging.
Minor phases can fractionate from dense oxides during sample
preparation, so their peak intensities are variable.
