SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"Brucite, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is a hydroxide typically found associated with
serpentine, dolomite, magnesite and chromite as a decomposition product
of magnesium silicates, especially serpentine.  The brucite spectrum
displays the best resolved vibrational bands in the present series, and
interpretation of its spectrum has received considerable attention in
the literature, The extremely sharp bands at 0.96&#181;m and near 1.5&#181;m
are clearly due to vibrations of the hydroxyl group.  The sharp band
near 0.74&#181;m likewise must be an overtone or combination tone of the OH
group, and it occurs at the shortest wavelength of any vibrational band
we have so far seen in this series.  The multiplicity of bands in the
brucite spectrum (as distinct from the single features in some of the
micas, and evidenced by the sharp, well-resolved group of features near
1.4&#181;m) have been variously interpreted as combinations of the fundamental
stretching vibration with librational motions of the hydroxyl ions
(Hexter, 1958); as combinations of the lattice vibrational modes with
the OH stretching vibrations (Buchanan and others, 1962); and as caused by
the close proximity of the hydroxyl ions in the brucite lattice, which
causes the hydroxyl groups to have specific but different orientations
and force constants (Boutin and Basset, 1963).  The strong broad bands
at longer wavelengths (2.32 and 2.49&#181;m) have been studied using oriented
crystals and polarized light (Mara and Sutherland, 1953).  They also
subjected the brucite to deuteration which resulted in appropriate
wavelength shifts in the spectrum, indicating that these bands are
indeed due to true OH vibrations."

MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:

<p>
Sample is contaminated with calcite (it fizzes with HCl).  See above XRD
discussion:  sample has about 8% calcite.  Calcite forms mostly powder
coating on the brucite grains.
