SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"SS-22. Sphalerite. Summit County, Colorado (136B). Sphalerite, ZnS, is the
  most important ore of zinc. It is typically deposited in veins by low temperature
  hydrothermal solutions. Sphalerite is colorless when pure, but naturally occurring
  samples are usually brown or black, the darkening occurring as iron substitutes
  for zinc. This sample is a resinous brown color, typical of sphalerite's. Zinc
  sulphide is a well known semiconductor material and, when doped with impurity
  ions, is a conventional phosphor. Doping with copper produces blue and /or green
  luminescence centers, while manganese produces orange-yellow centers. The presence
  of iron in the zinc sulphide acts as a luminescence killer. The macroscopic
  pure zinc sulphide lattice displays negligible absorption down to about 0.35&#181;,
  where the sharp absorption edge indicates the beginning of the conduction band.
  This sample of sphalerite does not display the near-infrared bands typical of
  either ferrous or ferric ions in other samples, because the iron is not in an
  octahedral site. It does show a rapid fall-off in reflectivity between 0.6&#181;
  and 0.35&#181;. This tail to the absorption edge of pure ZnS is probably caused
  by defects in the periodic lattice and boundary effects, as well as to some
  extrinsic absorption due to the impurity iron. The fall-off in reflectivity
  between 2.0 and 2.5&#181; is an unusual feature, which we have only noticed
  before in aluminum compounds. The explanation given there cannot be applied
  here. The valence band of zinc sulphide does not extend to such short wavelength
  and so we tentatively suggest that it may be due to the excitation of electrons
  from the valence band to some fundamental level of an impurity ion."

File: sphlt136.out, -.mdi <br>
References: JCPDS #5-566 <br>
Found: sphalerite, minor additional phase <br><br>
Comments: Sphalerite is the major phase with 5.41 Angstroms, consistent with pure (iron-free)
ZnS.  There are 5 unindexed reflections: 4 very small peaks at 3.52, 3.48, 2.12, and
1.98 Angstroms and moderately sized sharp peak at 3.05 Angstroms.  CaCO3 was sought
optically but not found.
