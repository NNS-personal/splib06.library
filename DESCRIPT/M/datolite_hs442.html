SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"N-15 Datolite 442B--Conn.  CaB(SiO<sub>4</sub>)(OH):  Datolite is typical of a
mineral of secondary origin found in cavities in basaltic lavas and
similar rocks.  Its spectrum is completely dominated by well-resolved
features near 1.02 &#181; , 1.26 &#181;, 1.48 &#181;, 1.74 &#181;, and 1.80 &#181;
as well as multiple bands between 2.1 and 2.5 &#181;.  The overall
appearance of this spectrum from 0.6 to 1.85 &#181; is essentially
identical with that of gypsum (see Part IV, p.  7-8, spectra SS 11-A
through D) including the unusual 1.7 &#181; feature, although all the
features in datolite are shifted slightly to longer wavelengths from the
corresponding positions in gypsum.  However, in datolite the intense 1.9
&#181; feature, indicative of the presence of molecular water is
completely absent, and yet the spectrum of gypsum is explained entirely
in terms of its molecular water of crystallization, with the 1.7 &#181;
feature involving librational modes of water.  It would seem therefore,
in the absence of water that the bands short of 1.85 &#181; in datolite
must be due to combination modes of at least two different types of OH
stretching vibrations.  The bands between 2.1 and 2.5 &#181; can be
explained in terms of combination of these OH stretching modes with
lattice modes with additional contributions from carbonate vibrations
(due to calcite, which is present as an impurity) and possibly from
combinations involving the boron-oxygen stretching modes (see Part V, p.
130-131, spectra B-1 through B-4)."
