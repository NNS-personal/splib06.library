SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Forms series with Cattierite (CoS<sub>2</sub>).  Dimorphous with Marcasite.

<p>
"SS-19.  Pyrite.  Rico, Colorado (35).  Pyrite, FeS<sub>2</sub>, is the most
common and widespread of sulphides.  It occurs in igneous, metamorphic
and sedimentary rocks, as well as in veins.  In the visible, pyrite
displays the reflectivity vs.  particle size behavior that is peculiar
to opaque minerals - ie.  reflectivity decreases as particle size
decreases.  It is also interesting that decreased absorption in the red
region of the visible results in a significant contrast in reflectivity
from the red to the blue, despite the sample's overall low reflectivity.
In the near-infrared, the spectral behavior of pyrite changes from that
of an opaque material to that of a transparent one.  This sample is
contaminated with grinder steel, which is probably responsible for its
low reflectivity throughout.  The smallest grain size is the only one
which shows a rise in reflectivity to longer wavelengths, producing what
appears to be an absorption edge between 1.1 and 1.5&#181;.  We feel,
however, that this is an artifact of the contamination in this sample,
and that it should display a weak ferrous ion band near 1&#181; like
marcasite, before changing from transparent to opaque behavior."
