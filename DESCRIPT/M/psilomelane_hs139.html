SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
"0-13. Psilomelane.  Magdalena, N.M. (139B).  "Psilomelane" is generally
used as a field term for any poorly characterized massive ore of manganese.
Much of the material originally cleared as psilomelane consists of mixtures of
several different minerals, usually with pyrolusite (Palache and others, 1944).
Psilomelane usually is of supergene origin, occurring typically as a
weathering product of manganiferous carbonates or silicates.  This particular
sample has a black streak, and yields very little water (0.09%) when heated.
Consequently, we conclude that it is composed in large part of pyrolusite.
Its spectrum is opaque and spectrally featureless, due to the conduction band
of MnO<sub>2</sub> extending throughout this spectral range."

"Many of the hard botryoidal masses formerly called psilomelane are now
known to be a mixture of several manganese oxides of which romanechite
is a major constituent.  Some of the other minerals commonly present in
the mixture are cryptomelane, KMn<sub>8</sub>,O<sub>16</sub>; manjiroite,
(Na,K)Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub><sup>.</sup>nH<sub>2</sub>O; and todorokite (Mn,Ca,Mg)
Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>.</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O."

XRD_ANALYSIS:

40 kV - 30 mA, 7.0-9.5 keV <br>
  File: psilm139.mdi (smear on quartz plate) <br>
References:  PDF2 #14-0627 <br>
Found:  Romanechite <br><br>
Comments:  All peaks are weak, most peaks broad, and the alpha1-alpha2 components
are not resolved.  The pattern has high background, probably due to Mn or Fe X-ray
fluorescence.  Within the range covered by the PDF2 data, all observed reflections
were indexable as romanechite.  There are some differences in intensity, however.
The PDF2 lists additional reflections which were not observed in our poor pattern.
