SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
Original spectrum published in:
Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1972, Visible
and near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  V.
Halides, phosphates, arsenates, vanadates and borates.
Modern Geology, v. 3, p. 121-132.

<p>
With the following notes:
"Monazite, (Ce, La, Y, Th)PO<sub>4</sub>, is a phosphate of the rare earth
metals usually found as a comparatively rare accessory mineral in
granitic rocks and pegmatites.  Because of its resistance to
weathering and high specific gravity, it is also found concentrated
in some beach sands."

<p>
"This sample is complicated not only by this multitudinous possibility for
  substitution, but also because there appears to be considerable apatite present
  as a contaminant."
<p>
"From the spectrum it would appear that at least some hydroxyl apatite and
  molecular water must be present. The bands at 0.55, 0.68, 0.75, 0.81, and 0.88&#181;m
  are all due to electronic transitions in the divalent lanthanum ion. The two
  smaller peaks at 0.68 and 0.88&#181;m spanning the intense doublet at 0.75 and
  0.81 are evident in the flame emission spectrum of lanthanum, and are perceptible
  in spectrum [Apatite HS253]. The features occurring between 1 and 2&#181;m indicate
  the presence of both molecular water and hydroxyl groups. This contention is
  supported by the mid-infrared spectrum of this sample which displays a very
  broad and intense band throughout the OH fundamental stretching region and a
  much weaker band at 1630cm<sup>-1</sup>, indicating the presence of molecular
  water. The bands near 1.0 and 1.2 microns are surprisingly well resolved and
  are probably due to combinations of various hydroxyl stretching modes, together
  with contributions from the overtone of the water bending mode combining with
  the stretching mode. The three bands between 1.4 and 1.6&#181;m indicates that
  there are probably several different OH groups present in very different environments.
  This sample is obviously far from pure monazite and the assignment of these
  vibrational overtone and combination tones is very tentative. Mass spectrographic
  analyses of this sample showed that the lanthanum to Ce ratio is 0.4, and that
  other rare earths were present in 1 to 10% quantities. It is possible that some
  contribution from these rare earth ions could be affecting the spectrum between
  1 and 2 microns."
<p>
Note: Nd<sup>3+</sup> and Sm<sup>3+</sup> are the source of the narrow absorption
features, not lanthanum as described above.

40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
File: monaz255.out, -.mdi <br>
Reference: JCPDS #32-199 <br>
Found: monazite <br>
Sought but not found: quartz, alkali feldspars

<p>
Comment: Peaks only moderately strong and sharp.  Not as well
crystallized as the zircon (WS-522).  Quartz << 1% could be obscured
by monazite reflections.
