SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:

<p>
This sample was originally described by Hunt and Salisbury as:

<p>
"H-5. Sylvite. Carlsbad, N.M. (430B). Sylvite, KC1, has the same origin, mode
  of occurrence and associations as halite, but is much rarer. Like halite, it
  is colorless when pure, but is more often some shade of red due to ferric oxide
  inclusions. It may also be yellow or blue, and it has been suggested that the
  blue coloration is due to F-centers in inclusions of rock salt. This sample
  is reddish orange, and the absorption less than of 0.55 &#181; is due to ferric
  oxide inclusions. The well-defined bands in the near-infrared at 1.0, 1.23,
  1.46, 1.77, 1.99, and 2.27 &#181; are clearly due to water of hydration. Except
  for a small shift to longer wavelengths these bands are essentially identical
  with those found in gypsum (see spectra SS-11A, B, C, D, in Part IV). The sylvite
  obviously contains some hydrated impurity, although it does not appear to be
  gypsum in this case. Most probably it is magnesium chloride hydrate, but almost
  any hydrate produces a set of bands similar to those displayed here."

near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  V.  Halides, phosphates,
arsenates, vanadates and borates.  Modern Geology, v.  3, p.  121-132.

<p>
XRD has shown this sample to be primarily Carnallite.  The visible
and near infrared spectral features are from Carnallite.

XRD_ANALYSIS:

<p>
45 kV - 35 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br>
 Reference: JCPDS #28-869 <br>
 Found: Carnallite plus an unidentified reflection at 3.16-3.16
        Angstroms. <br><br>
  Comments: All strong reflections on the JCPDS card were found. The carnallite
  reflections are sharp, indicating good crystallinity. The unidentified reflection
  is broad and may be a doublet.
